# Pinch-and-Zoom-App

Create advanced Pinch and Zoom features with SwiftUI gestures by developing this fun and engaging iPhone and iPad mobile application in Xcode editor.

* SwiftUI Gestures
The main topic of this short and engaging iOS project is to get familiar with almost every SwiftUI gesture such as long-press gesture, double-tap gesture, drag gesture, and magnification gesture (a gesture that recognizes a magnification motion and tracks the amount of it).

* SwiftUI Materials
Apply a blur effect (with color vibrancy) to a view that appears behind another view by adding a material with the background modifier. The new SwiftUI material is not a view, but adding material is like inserting a translucent layer between the modified view and its background.

* SF Symbols
With over 3200 icons, SF Symbols is a library of iconography designed to integrate seamlessly, the system font for Apple platforms. New rendering modes provide greater control over how color is applied to symbols.
